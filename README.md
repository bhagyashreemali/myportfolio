## 📖 Project Overview

This repository hosts the clean, production-ready source code for my personal portfolio. It's designed as a high-performance **static site** utilizing only **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**, ensuring high performance without heavy frameworks.

### ✨ Key Features: Where Code Comes Alive

* **Dynamic Hero Section:** The main introduction features a **JavaScript-powered typing effect** that dynamically showcases professional roles, immediately grabbing the visitor's attention.
* **Scroll Reveal UI:** Implements "Scroll Reveal" animations via the **Intersection Observer API** for modern, smooth element transitions as the user scrolls.
* **Mobile-First Design:** Features a dedicated **mobile-first hamburger menu** and responsive grid layouts for perfect viewing on any device.
* **Professional Theming:** Utilizes **CSS Variables** (`--primary-color`, `--accent-color`) for consistent, modern theming in Dark Slate Blue and Tech Teal.
* **Technical Showcase:** Structured grid layouts to clearly differentiate **Programming**, **AI/ML**, and **Web Development** skills.

## 💡 Design Philosophy & Performance

This portfolio was built with two core principles in mind: **Speed** and **Clarity**.

* **Minimalist Design:** The site utilizes a clean, modern aesthetic with ample negative space to direct the user's focus immediately to the content—skills, projects, and experience.
* **Accessibility Focus (A11y):** The HTML is written with **semantic tags** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) to ensure compatibility with screen readers and assistive technologies, meeting WCAG standards.
* **Zero Frameworks Benefit:** By using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, the site achieves a minimal footprint (under 100KB total payload), resulting in an exceptional **Lighthouse Performance Score** and instant loading times.
* **Modular CSS:** Styles are organized logically using modern CSS practices, making the design easy to maintain and scale.
