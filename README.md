## 📖 About The Project

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio. The website is built to be fast, responsive, and visually engaging, serving as a central hub for my professional identity.

It features a clean, modern UI designed with **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**, ensuring high performance without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Dynamic Hero Section:** Features a JavaScript-powered typing effect that cycles through my professional roles.
* **Interactive UI:** Implements "Scroll Reveal" animations that fade elements in as the user scrolls down the page.
* **Responsive Navigation:** Includes a mobile-first hamburger menu that toggles smoothly on smaller screens.
* **Project Showcase:** A grid layout displaying key projects like "Brainwave AI" and "Image Caption Generator".
* **Modern Styling:** Utilizes CSS variables for consistent theming (Dark Slate Blue & Tech Teal) and Flexbox/Grid for layout.
