## 📖 About The Project

This repository hosts the clean, production-ready source code for my personal portfolio. The website is designed to be fast, responsive, and visually engaging, serving as a central hub for my professional identity.

It features a clean, modern UI designed using core web technologies: **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**, ensuring high performance without the overhead of external frameworks.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Dynamic Hero Section:** Features a JavaScript-powered typing effect that cycles through professional roles (`AIML Engineer`, `Web Developer`, etc.).
* **Interactive UI:** Implements **"Scroll Reveal"** animations that fade elements into view as the user scrolls down the page.
* **Responsive Navigation:** Includes a **mobile-first hamburger menu** implemented purely with JavaScript for smooth toggling on smaller screens.
* **Modern Styling:** Utilizes **CSS Variables** for consistent theming (`Dark Slate Blue` & `Tech Teal`) and **Flexbox/Grid** for layout.
